we could do that check every available spot with the next 6 moves
but the sizing would have to change as that would take too 
long to compute


we need to make it remember it's last moves so that it
does't count more than once. maybe add the block into 
a temp list of snakes
could make add the new move to the list of snakes
every move you  remove the last part of your own 
snake from the list. unless you ate food then you skip 
it for the current turn

we could add the # of available blocks to the score for
each entry. It might just mean that we sacrifice 
move depth. this could be accomplished by leveraging off of
our older code

just a consideration but we can increase or decrease the depth
depending on what percent of the board is free and how many directions
the snake can move in

it now has decent spacial awareness (as in it won't run into a dead end)
now we just need to hone our targeting and priorities.
